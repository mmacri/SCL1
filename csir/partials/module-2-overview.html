      <h3>Communications flow</h3>
      <p>Internal notifications move from local OT teams to Incident Commander and Technical Lead, with ECS and Compliance coordinating regulatory messaging. Severe or Tier 1/AtC cases escalate to City IMT and external agencies (E‑ISAC, CISA/NCCIC, regulators).</p>
